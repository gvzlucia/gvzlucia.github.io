Hi,

Welcome to my virtual spot in the cosmos of networks!

I am a philologist, an editor and a translator. I am passionate about learning, researching and nature. I hold a MA and a BA in languages, literatures, and linguistics. I have experience in research, education, writing, communications and tourism. Hablo español a nivel nativo, advanced English, un peu français, eu entendo um pouco de portugues, 나는 약간의 한국어를 이해한다, 我懂一些中文。

In 2022 I launched a personal project that focus on literary writings and their connections with nature and sensitivity. Not long ago I became a volunteer translator at TED, to gain professional experience and help the platform with my service. I used to be an English tutor, planning the lessons and creating personalized activities for the students. I also used to be an intern at a Hotel, there I provided the team with my language skills and acquired knowledge about how a private business work. In the future, if I have the opportunity, I would love to pursue a PhD in comparative philology studies.

Please feel free to contact me via any of the links provided below.
