Hi and welcome to my virtual spot in the cosmos of networks.

[I](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luciagvz/) am a philologist, an editor and a translator. I am passionate about learning, researching and nature. I have a MA and a BA in Languages, literatures, and linguistics; with a specialization in English and Spanish studies. I have experience in research, education, writing, communications and tourism. Hablo español a nivel nativo, advanced English, un peu français, eu entendo um pouco de portugues, 나는 약간의 한국어를 이해한다, 我懂一些中文。

In 2022 I launched a [personal project](https://wildeheorte.wordpress.com); a website where I talk about literary writings and its connection with nature and sensitivity. And not long ago I became a [volunteer translator](https://www.ted.com/profiles/41428437/about) at TED, to gain professional experience and to help the platform by providing translations and transcriptions. I used to be a tutor of English as a foreign language; there I planned the lessions and created some activities. One day, If I have the opportunity, I would love to pursue a PhD in comparative philology studies. 

Lastly, I here quote a piece of E.E. Cummings words "(for young is the year, for young is the year) / let's touch the sky: / with a great (and a gay and a steep) deep rush through amazing day [...] let's do as an earth which can never do wrong does / (minute by second and most by more) / let's touch the sky: / with a strange (and a true) / and a climbing fall into far near blue".
